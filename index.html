        <h1>Real beauty resides in imperfection</h1>
        <p>
          In a digital era, we sometimes feel the need to interact with
          something more human that will<br>
          make us appreciate both the beauty and the imperfection of something
          made by hand.

        <h1>Expressiveness is... the new black</h1>
        <p>

          Welcome to my space for experiments! Look at this like a journey we
          can take together every<br />
          step of the way, beginning another chapter with each new phase of the
          project development. And<br />
          who knows where it will take us?

          Each illustration offers the possibility of limitless interpretations

          It depends only on each one's creativity and free spirit.
